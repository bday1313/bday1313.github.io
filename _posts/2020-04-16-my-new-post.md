The two things that I love to do in my free time go hand in hand, smoking a good cigar and choosing the right beer to pair it with. Now if I was only born 
with two set of arms like some of the gods i could play my video games at the same time.




The two ideas that I have found datasets for my projects are: 

[Canned Beer Data](https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans)

[Beer Review](https://www.kaggle.com/rdoume/beerreviews)

[Tobacco](https://www.statista.com/statistics/192022/top-10-tobacco-producing-us-states/)
